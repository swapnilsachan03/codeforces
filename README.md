# Swapnil's Codeforces Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various Codeforces problems that I have solved. The solutions are mostly implemented in C++.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- `/` - Contains all my solutions categorized by problem ID.
- `cph/` - Includes input-output test cases for cph.
- `.gitignore` - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- `README.md` - This file.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/swapnilsachan03/codeforces.git
   cd codeforces
   ```

2. **Read a problem solution**
   ```sh
   A_Buttons  # Example: Problem - 1858A - Buttons
   ```

3. **Compile and Run (C++ Example)**
   ```sh
   g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall A_Buttons.cpp -o A_Buttons.out
   ./A_Buttons.out < testcases/A_Buttons_input.txt > output.txt
   ```

   *__or__* you can install *__cph extension in VS Code__*, the repository contains all the testcase files for every problem which cph needs to run the code.
