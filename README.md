# Swapnil's CP-31 solutions

This repository contains solutions to all the contests that I solve on Codeforces, you can refer these for your understanding. The solutions are implemented in C++.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- `/` - Contains folders for each contest like `1777`, `1866`, etc.
- `contest/cph` - Includes input-output test cases for cph inside the folder for each contest.
- `.gitignore` - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- `README.md` - This file.

## ü™∂ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/swapnilsachan03/codeforces.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the folder of the contest you're looking for**
   ```sh
   cd rating
   ```

3. **Read a problem solution**
   ```sh
   A_Cover_in_Water.cpp  # Example: Problem - 1900A - Cover in Water
   ```

4. **Compile and Run (C++ Example)**
   ```sh
   g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -Wall A_Cover_in_Water.cpp -o A_Cover_in_Water.out
   ./A_Buttons.out < testcases/A_Buttons_input.txt > output.txt
   ```

   *__or__* you can install *__cph extension in VS Code__*, the repository contains all the testcase files for every problem which cph needs to run the code.

## üìù Must-Try Codeforces Problems
Though all the problems are worth trying, here are some that I found particularly interesting, sorted by rating:

### **Rated 800**
- 112A - Petya and Strings

### **Rated 900**
- 327A - Flipping Game

## ‚≠ê Contributions
This is a personal repository, so I don't think you'd want to contribute here, but feel free to open an issue if you feel there's a mistake somewhere in the code!

## üìú License
This repository is for educational purposes. Feel free to use the solutions for learning, but do not use them for just copying & pasting, this'll help in your own growth!

Happy Coding üöÄ
